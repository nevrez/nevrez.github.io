I am currently employed as a Senior Researcher at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tokyo, Japan since April 2016. 

My research interests include applications of computer vision and machine learning, recently with special interests on deep learning for multi-modal or multi-temporal signal/image analysis, visual attention (saliency detection), classification/object detection/segmentation on various sensory data (3D, optical, multispectral, hyperspectral). I am still eager to learn and experience new things in different fields/domain to improve myself and my research activities.
