I am currently employed as a Senior Researcher at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tokyo, Japan since April 2016. Before AIST, I was with RIKEN Brain Science Institute as a Researcher & JSPS Foreign Postdoctoral Fellow in 2015-2016. I received the Ph.D. degree from Chiba University (2015), Japan, with a Japanese Government scholarship (MEXT). I was also with School of Computer Eng., Nanyang Technbological University, Singapore as a Research Associate 2010-2011. I received the M.S. and B.S. degrees from TOBB University of Economics and Technology (Ankara, Turkey) and Cankaya University (Ankara, Turkey) in 2010 and 2007. 

My research interests include applications of computer vision and machine learning, recently with special interests on deep learning for multi-modal or multi-temporal signal/image analysis, visual attention (saliency detection), classification/object detection/segmentation on various sensory data (3D, optical, multispectral, hyperspectral). I am still eager to learn and experience new things in different fields/domain to improve myself and my research activities.
